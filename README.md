# OIBSIP Internship Projects

## Introduction

Welcome to my OIBSIP internship repository. This repository contains the solutions to the tasks assigned during my internship at OASIS INFOBYTE. The tasks focus on different areas of data science and machine learning, providing hands-on experience with various techniques and methodologies.

## Basic Information
OASIS INFOBYTE is a community of diverse people coming together with similar objectives and ultimate goals. It focuses on creating opportunities for leadership development, learning, student engagement, and fostering shared interests. OASIS INFOBYTE develops enriching environments and experiences that promote students' knowledge and well-being.

## Tasks Overview

### Task 1: Iris Flower Classification

#### Objective:
To classify iris flowers into three species - setosa, versicolor, and virginica based on their measurements.

#### Details:
The task involves training a machine learning model that can learn from the measurements of the iris species and classify them accordingly. The dataset used for this task is provided by the Scikit-learn library.

#### Files:

- **Data_science_task1:** Contains all the code for the iris flower classification task.
- **Data_science_task1/README.md**: Explanation of the code and methodology used.


### Task 2: Email Spam Detection

#### Objective:
To detect whether an email is spam or not using machine learning techniques.

#### Details:
This task involves preprocessing email text data, vectorizing it, and training a machine learning model to classify emails as spam or non-spam.

#### Files:

- **Data_science_task2:** Contains all the code for the email spam detection task.
- **Data_science_task2/README.md:** Explanation of the code and methodology used.

  
### Task 3: Car Price Prediction with Machine Learning

#### Objective:
To predict the price of a car based on various factors such as brand, features, horsepower, and mileage.

#### Details:
The task involves training a machine learning model that can learn from car attributes and predict the selling price. This project is crucial as car price prediction is a major research area in machine learning.

#### Files:

- **Data_science_task3:** Contains all the code for the car price prediction task.
- **Data_science_task3/README.md:** Explanation of the code and methodology used.
